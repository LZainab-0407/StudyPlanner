## Features

### **Add & Edit Tasks**
  - Add tasks with a title, description, priority level, and deadline
  - Edit any field of an existing task
  - Deadline input uses a calendar date picker (`JDateChooser`)

### **Complete Tasks**
  - Check off tasks to mark them as complete
  - Completed tasks are highlighted in green

### **Delete Tasks**
  - Remove tasks permanently from your list

### **Task List Dashboard**
  - Shows tasks as lists.
  - Each task is color-coded according to its priority level.
  - Easily toggle between:
    - Pending Tasks
    - Overdue Tasks
    - Completed Tasks
    - All Tasks
   
### **Sort Task List**
  - Sort by **priority level** (High â†’ Low)
  - Sort by **deadline** (Sooner â†’ Later)
 
### **Calendar Dashboard** 
  - Visual calendar interface as the default home view after login
  - Week View: Shows detailed and highlighted task titles & descriptions in a 7-day layout (default home after login)
    - Click on the highlighted tasks to view details, or complete or delete the task.
  - Month View: Shows a full month with task dots per day
    - Click on the dot to view task details, or complete or delete the task.
  - Click the side menu of a day to view, complete, or show details of tasks due on that date
  - Navigate between weeks or months.
 
### **Statistics Dashboard** 
  - Visual insights into your productivity:
    - Total Tasks
    - Completed Today/This Week
    - Pending / Overdue
    - Completion Rate with Progress Bar
      
  - Interactive chart panel with toggles:
    - ðŸŒ¦ Task Forecast (Stacked Bar Chart)
    - ðŸ“‹ Task Distribution (Pie Chart)
    - ðŸ“‰ Overdue History (Line Chart â€“ 7/14/30 day range)
  - Uses JFreeChart for high-quality, customizable charts

### **Search & Filter Tasks** 
  - Keyword-based search (title, description, or status)
  - Filter tasks by:
    - **Priority level**
    - **Status**: Completed, Overdue, Due today, Due tomorrow, Due this week, Due next week, Due in 3/14/30 days
  - Combine search and filters for precise results
  - Results are displayed dynamically in a scrollable list

### **Cloud Sync** 
  - Tasks are saved to a centralized Google Sheet, allowing multiple users to manage their own data across devices.

### **User Authentication** 
  - Supports signup and login with credentials stored securely in the cloud.

### **User Management in the Cloud**
  - User credentials (username + password) are stored in a **Users** sheet.
  - Each task includes a `username` field, so user data is separated securely.
  - During signup, the app checks the **Users** sheet to prevent duplicate usernames.
  - During login, credentials are validated against the **Users** sheet.
  
### **Log Out**
  - Securely log out from the session
  - Automatically saves tasks before exiting to the login screen

## Saving Strategy (Performance Optimization)
To reduce API calls and improve performance:
- Tasks are only saved to Google Sheets:
  - When the user clicks a "Save Now" button (optional)
  - On logout
  - On closing the app
- An internal `taskListModified` flag tracks unsaved changes.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Swing** â€“ for GUI
- **MVC Architecture** â€“ to separate model, view, and control logic
- **JCalendar Library** â€“ for date picking (via `JDateChooser`)
- **Custom Icons & Styling** â€“ from https://icons8.com/icons Clean and modern UI
- **Google Sheets API (OAuth 2.0 authentication)**
- **Maven for dependency management**

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to clone, run, and try the StudyPlanner app with full functionality (including Google Sheets cloud sync).
1. Prerequisites
    -  Java 21+
    -  Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (or any IDE that supports Maven)
    -  Git
    -  A Google Account (for using the Sheets integration)

2. Clone the Repository

3. Google Sheets API Setup
    - The app uses Google Sheets as a cloud backend. To access Sheets via the API, contact me to be added as a test user. This is required because the app is still in Google OAuth testing mode, so send your Google email address to: labibah.mimm@gmail.com.
    - Once added as a test user, run the app. A browser window will open the Google Authorization screen
    - Sign in and allow access. A token will be saved locally for future sessions.

4. Config and Credential Files
    - Once you are added as a test user, I can securely share this file with you. Save it in the following path: src/main/resources/credentials.json

5. Run the App
    - Sign up as a new user and start using the StudyPlanner!
